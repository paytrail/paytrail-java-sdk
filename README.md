# Paytrail Java SDK

The goal for this project is to develop a Java SDK for the [Paytrail payment service](https://www.paytrail.com/en). The aim is to provide Java developers with an easier and more streamlined way to integrate our API into their applications.

The initial version of the Java SDK will be focused on basic payment handling and backend usage, specifically enabling communication with the [Paytrail payment API](https://docs.paytrail.com/#/). As such, it will not include any frontend functionalities, but we may provide examples for frontend implementation at a later stage.

## Paytrail Payment Service

Paytrail is a payment gateway that offers 20+ payment methods for Finnish customers.

The payment gateway provides all the popular payment methods with one simple integration. The provided payment methods include, but are not limited to, credit cards, online banking and mobile payments.

To use the payment service, you need to sign up for a Paytrail account. Transaction fees will be charged for every transaction. Transaction cost may vary from merchant to merchant, based on what is agreed upon with Paytrail when negotiating your contract. For more information and registration, please visit our [website](https://www.paytrail.com) or contact asiakaspalvelu@paytrail.com directly.

### Testing ###

You can test our payment services in your online store before signing an agreement. Payments made using [test credentials](https://docs.paytrail.com/#/?id=test-credentials) will not be processed.

With test credentials, you can test most of the payment methods included in Paytrail’s payment service. You can find the payment method specific credentials needed for testing in Paytrail’s [documentation](https://docs.paytrail.com/#/payment-method-providers).
